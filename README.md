There are 4 players and 15 cards, numbered from 1 to 15. 7 cards are drawn from random. The sum of the 7 cards is the market value of the product we are making the market for. The other 8 cards will be discarded.

At the start of the game, each of the players will receive a card. Each player only knows their own card. There are 4 rounds. After each of the first 3 rounds, one of the remaining 3 cards is revealed to all the players. Each of the players will take turn to make the market for the product (with a spread of 1). The other players will then have to buy/sell between 1-3 products. For example, if Player 1 is making a market of 54-55, other players can buy 1-3 products at 55, or sell 1-3 products at 54.

The order is as follows:

ROUND 1:

Player 1 makes the market. The rest decides to buy/sell.
Player 2 makes the market. The rest decides to buy/sell.
Player 3 makes the market. The rest decides to buy/sell.
